            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Simon Color Game is a classic electronic game that was first introduced in 1978. It is a memory game
                that tests your ability to remember and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds.</p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The game consists of four colored buttons: red, blue, green, and yellow. The game starts with the
                computer flashing one of the buttons in a random sequence. Your goal is to repeat the sequence by
                pressing the buttons in the correct order.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Press the start button to begin the game.</li>
                <li>Watch and listen carefully as the computer flashes the colors in a sequence.</li>
                <li>Repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.</li>
                <li>If you get the sequence right, the computer will add another color to the sequence.</li>
                <li>If you get the sequence wrong, the game is over.</li>
                <li>Continue playing until you reach the maximum level or lose the game.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Scoring</h2>
            <p>The score is based on the level you reach. Each level adds one more color to the sequence, making it
                harder to remember. The game is over once you make a mistake.</p>
